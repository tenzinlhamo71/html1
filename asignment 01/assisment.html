		of life is a unique survival game with over 400 items and 15+ crafting stations. The story takes place on a tropical island somewhere in the pacific ocean. Being fed up with everyday chores and responsibilities you decide to take a journey of self discovery and decide to go on a tropical island. <big>You are transported to the island by a local ship and left without any man made items or luxuries. When you land on the island, you must craft basic tools to progress. By using various workstations you make progress towards the end game goal which is to make a ship and sail back to civilization, or the next biome.</big><!--this is a big tag--> Beware this island isn't an ordinary island, its filled with dangerous animals and poisonous plants. Grow your own food, craft traps for animals, hunt, adapt, overcome your fears and in the end be the king of the island. What's a skilled craftsman without proper tools? In order to upgrade your tools you will need to mine, crush, <mark>	smelt and cast your metals into molds which are used to craft better tools.</mark>
