	  <h2>Letter from the CEO to the Employees</h2>
	  <p>
	  	This letter is based on the talks the CEO gave to the employees on 3rd March 2020 and 19th June 2020 to explain the company’s vision, mission and the work culture as the company was undergoing a lot of transformation and recruiting new people to build up the IT services department. These talks were very important in bringing the employees to embrace the collective vision, mission and work culture since the staff came from different organisations. This letter will serve to orient the new employees in the future too to the company’s vision, mission and work culture.
